### WVVW

WVVW is a homage to the Terry Cavanagh's excellent VVVVVV game. It was developed in 48 hours for Ludum Dare #27 game jam, using C# and XNA (with my [Flai.XNA](https://github.com/JaakkoLipsanen/Flai.XNA) library). I developed also an built-in editor for creating the levels.

You can download the game in the Releases tab.
Requires [XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)
